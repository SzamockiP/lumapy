// Optional GPU capabilities, addressed by what they *do* rather than by which
// Vulkan version or extension happens to spell them on a given driver.
//
// Why this exists: Vulkan promotes extensions into core versions, so the same
// capability has two spellings depending on the driver (VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering
// is an extension on 1.2 and core in 1.3). "Which version + which extensions" is
// therefore not a user's decision — it's an implementation detail this library
// resolves per device. Exposing it would force the user to know the Vulkan
// trivia the library exists to hide.
//
// Adding a capability later is an additive enum entry, never a breaking change,
// which is why there is no need to save new features for a 2.0.
enum class Feature

	DEPTH_CLAMP,            // depthClamp
	SAMPLE_RATE_SHADING,    // sampleRateShading
	MULTI_DRAW_INDIRECT,    // multiDrawIndirect
	SHADER_FLOAT64,         // shaderFloat64

// Every Feature above maps to a plain VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures boolean, so the
// table is a name plus a pointer-to-member. Capabilities that need a version or
// an extension (ray tracing, mesh shaders) slot into this same table with extra
// columns when there is API in bazalt to actually use them — advertising them
// before that would be a hollow promise.
